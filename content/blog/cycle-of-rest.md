## Rest as pattern

Rest is not an apology for being tired—it is a pattern that keeps our nervous system from staying in threat mode. Imagine rest like the ocean: waves of effort followed by waves of stillness.

## Small experiments

- Schedule micro-pauses between meetings.
- Keep a "tired list" of actions that restore you quickly.
- Notice when rest feels earned versus allowed.

## Closing note

When rest is part of the day, not the prize at the end, we become steadier companions to ourselves and to others.
