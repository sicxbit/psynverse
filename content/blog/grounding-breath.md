## Why pause matters

Our days rarely offer natural pauses. The nervous system learns to expect urgency. A grounding breath interrupts the reflex to hurry.

## A three-part ritual

1. Inhale slowly for four counts.
2. Hold gently for two counts.
3. Exhale for six counts.

Repeat for three rounds. Notice the temperature of the air, the weight of your feet, and the steadiness that returns.
