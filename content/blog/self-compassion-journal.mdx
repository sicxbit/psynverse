## A softer inner voice

Criticism keeps us vigilant; compassion keeps us resilient. When the day feels sharp, try these prompts.

### Prompt 1: Naming

Write one sentence about what hurt. Use plain language without judgment.

### Prompt 2: Witnessing

Ask: *What would I say to a friend who felt this?* Offer yourself the same words.

### Prompt 3: Returning

Close with a small action that brings you back to your body—stretching, water, or stepping outside for air.
